          1 |            | Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose, pal! I'm the Sultan of Sentiment!                                                                                                    |    16 | butter_bridge | 2020-04-06 13:17:00
          2 |            | The beautiful thing about treasure is that it exists. Got to find out what kind of sheets these are; not cotton, not rayon, silky.                                                   |    14 | butter_bridge | 2020-10-31 03:03:00
          3 |            | Replacing the quiet elegance of the dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of these muted earth tones is a form of fashion suicide, but, uh, call me crazy — onyou it works. |   100 | icellusedkars | 2020-03-01 01:13:00
         14 |            | What do you see? I have no idea where this will lead us. This place I speak of, is known as the Black Lodge.                                                                         |    16 | icellusedkars | 2020-06-09 06:00:00
         17 |            | The owls are not what they seem.                                                                                                                                                     |    20 | icellusedkars | 2020-03-14 17:02:00
         18 |            | This morning, I showered for nine minutes.                                                                                                                                           |    16 | butter_bridge | 2020-07-21 01:20:00
